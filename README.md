#  Wildfires, Flooding, and Soil Composition in Washington State (1996–2020)
This project explores the interplay between natural disasters, specifically wildfires and flooding, in Washington State. It examines how soil composition influences the connection between wildfire occurrence and flooding risk. According to the National Park Service (2023), wildfires in desert regions can damage soil by removing the sparse vegetation, which decreases the soil's ability to absorb water and heightens the potential for water flow to cause further damage. Building on this insight, we aim to investigate this phenomenon on a broader scale by analyzing wildfire and flooding data and trends across Washington State's diverse landscapes.
